	* general: moved additional build-scripts from rootdir to build_aux
	* mdate-sh: added from automake 1.11.1
	* config.sub, config.guess: updated to recent versions from
	  git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=config.git to solve build issues
	  on different machines, but backported support for "ancient" systems
	  without uname(1) [removed 2014-01-25] from old version
